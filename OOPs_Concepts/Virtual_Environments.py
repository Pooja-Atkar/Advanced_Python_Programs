# Suppose we have two projects P1 and P2.
# if P1 have 20 Package and P2 have 10 package.
# if someone required P1 project then all 30 package send to that person.
# we can't separate the 20 and 10 package because all store in single folder.
# so Virtual Environment come to the picture.
# With the help of virtual environment we can separate 20 and 10 package.
